- implement generalized Halton in C
- create demo 'basket option'

- mention and *check* input for korobov: good 'n', 'd', 'generator'?
- n should be a prime or a power of two
- if n is a power of two, the generator has to be odd
- the generator should be a primitive element mod n ()

- Let G be a finite multiplicative group of integers. g in G is called primitive element
  mod p if g is of order (p-1) mod p (i.e., the smallest positive number such
  that g^<this number> = 1 is (p-1) mod p). Characterization: if and only if
  {g^k: 0 <= k <= p-2} = multiplicative group mod p
