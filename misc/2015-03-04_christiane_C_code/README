Generalized Halton: 

1st line (method) 18
2nd line =dimension
3rd line = number of points (n)
4th param = 1 (as we are currently forcing a random digital shift)
5th param: number of randomizations (m)
6th and 7th param: must be set to 2
8th param: 1 if original Halton and 6 if generalized Halton with Faure & Lemixu 2009 factors
9th param: skip of Y (will skip the first Y points)

Korobov (or more generally, rank-1 rule)

1st line (method) = 2
2nd line dimension
3rd line number of points
4th param: 1 for no randomization, 2 for shift (3 would do a digital shift)
5th param: number of randomizations
6th and 7th param: must be set to 2
8th param: generator
9th parameter: 
**1 if n is prime and Korobov rule
**2 if n is a power of 2 and Korobov rule
**3 if we want to use the extensible construction
**4 if we want a rank-1 rule: need to put the generating vector in rank1.dat
**5 if we want an extensible rank-1 rule: generating vector must be in rank.dat
